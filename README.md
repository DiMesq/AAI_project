Final project for Advancing AI through Cognitive Science class (Spring 2019)

The goal of this project is to combine each image of a handwritten character with its corresponding stroke data (Omniglot dataset - https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) to train deep learning models for the one-shot classification task of the Omniglot challenge.
